# Multiple Disease Predictor

## About

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. There is a mobile app version of this work is in under construction. Hope you will like it . The webapp can predict following Diseases:

- Diabetes
- Breast Cancer
- Heart Disease
- Kidney Disease
- Liver Disease
- Malaria
- Pneumonia

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Diabetes       | Machine Learning Model   | 98.25%   |
| Breast Cancer  | Machine Learning Model   | 98.25%   |
| Heart Disease  | Machine Learning Model   | 85.25%   |
| Kidney Disease | Machine Learning Model   | 99%      |
| Liver Disease  | Machine Learning Model   | 78%      |
| Malaria        | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 96%      |
| Pneumonia      | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 95%      |
